# NucID: Nucleosomes Identified using DNase-seq
NucID is a Python package for identifying nucleosomes using single-end DNase-seq data. It calculates a Bayes-factor--based nucleosome score for DNase-seq data in a 147 base pair genomic window. Genome-wide nucleosome scores are calculated using a sliding window approach.
